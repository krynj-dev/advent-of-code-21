## About this Repository
This repository serves to host my solutions to the challenges posed in the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for 2021.

From the website, the challenge can be summarised as:
> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

For me, this is a fun way to keep my coding skills sharp while I am between university and a job in software engineering.

Typically I code in Python as it is the main language taught at the university in which I studied. However, to challenge myself I will be using `C++` and `Java` to complete these tasks as a way to refresh myself on useful languages I covered (but did not consistently use) throughout my studies.

The current plan for distributing these langauges is as follows:
- 1/12 - 13/12: `C++`
- 14/12 - 25/12: `Java`

Any changes I make to this plan will be noted in this readme.
